run_multiple_daemons runs four daemon instances on one machine.  Useful to
test polling.  By default, the first instance calls polls on whatever it
has collected, inviting the other three instances to vote.

To run:
  cd test/frameworks/run_multiple_daemons
  ./start
  ...   (connect to daemons on ports 8081, 8082, 8083, 8084
         user=lockss-u, passwd=lockss-p)
  ./stop

See ./testN/test.out for errors and other messages.

UI access is initially allowed from localhost (127.0.0.1).  For access
from other hosts either use a browser on localhost or add the line
  org.lockss.ui.access.ip.include=<ip-address-or-subnet>
to ./lockss.opt .  E.g.,
  org.lockss.ui.access.ip.include=192.168.10.0/24

To test a new plugin, put it in the appropriate package dir in the
toplevel plugins/src/ tree, add its name to org.lockss.plugin.registry
(in test/frameworks/common.xml), run "ant jar-plugins" then start the
daemons.

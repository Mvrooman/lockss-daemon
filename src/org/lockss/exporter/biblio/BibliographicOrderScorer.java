/**
 * This is a utility class intended to provide some measure of whether a
 * particular ordering of BibliographicItem objects, based on either year or
 * volume fields, provides an appropriately consistent ordering for both fields.
 * The main purpose is to decide which ordering gives the most consistent (and
 * therefore, we assume, more likely to be correct) results. To decide this
 * we need to know which field was used to order the list. There are two ways
 * of assessing the ordering - looking at the consistency of the whole list,
 * and at the consistency of individual ranges that have been created by
 * identifying coverage gaps in that list.
 * <p>
 * When a list of AUs is ordered in a supposedly chronological order, we expect
 * that the years will be monotonically increasing. This is unfortunately not
 * always the case, so we have to provide a more flexible metric which allows
 * them to overlap slightly. We also expect that the volume sequence should only
 * increase, but this assumption is routinely broken because volume identifier
 * formats change or reset, or sometimes are inconsistently mixed.
 * <p>
 * Volume is the preferred field to inform the calculation of coverage gaps,
 * because it tends to display more consistency. There should be minimal
 * duplication and in general the values should be increasing; it should
 * therefore be simpler to identify whether or not a sequence is unbroken.
 * However because of the inconsistencies mentioned above, and missing data, it
 * is sometimes necessary to fall back on the year sequence to validate the
 * coverage gaps suggested by the volume ordering. When the volume ordering
 * looks particularly suspicious or inconsistent, the list of AUs can be
 * reordered by year to see if that gives a more consistent ordering and set
 * of coverage ranges.
 *
 * <h2>Volume/Year Sequence Consistency</h2>
 *
 * <i>
 * Volume strings can be interpreted as numbers (integers or Roman numerals),
 * mixed strings, or a range defined by a pair of either of the preceding types
 * separated by a hyphen.
 * <br/><br/>
 * Year strings can only be interpreted as 4-digit integers or a range defined
 * by a pair of 4-digit integers separated by a hyphen.
 * </i>
 * <p>
 * A volume sequence is consistent if, over each range defined by the
 * ordered sequence, each volume identifier (or the start or end identifier
 * of a range, depending on the context of the AU in the sequence) is equal to,
 * or an increment of, the previous one. This gets harder to assess for
 * string-based volumes, but sequences which are numerical and consecutive will
 * in general get a high score.
 * <p>
 * A year sequence is consistent if, over each range defined by the
 * ordered sequence, each start date is greater than or equal to the
 * previous start date <b><i>or</i></b> the start of the first range is
 * is included in the second range (in other words there is some kind of
 * overlap).
 *
 * <h2>Appropriate Consecutivity</h2>
 *
 * It is acceptable for consecutive years to be the same; they can also exhibit
 * breaks within a coverage period as long as the volumes are appropriately
 * consecutive and the years are increasing. This allows for the fact that there
 * may be legitimate gaps between consecutive volumes of greater than a year,
 * and also that multiple volumes may get published within a single year.
 * Additionally, particular volume identifiers can be repeated within
 * consecutive AUs, because for example the volume was published in chunks
 * across several years.
 * <p>
 * The concept of "appropriate consecutivity" is more flexible for years; if
 * volumes cannot be recognised as appropriately consecutive, it is safer to
 * record a coverage gap.
 *
 * <h2>Summary</h2>
 *
 * There are methods for checking the strict consecutivity of both years and
 * volumes represented as integers or strings; for checking whether values are
 * increasing or decreasing; and whether pairs of years or volumes appear to be
 * <i>appropriately consecutive</i> (are close enough to be considered
 * consecutive if the other field suggests so) or <i>appropriately sequenced</i>
 * (not causing concern that the AU ordering is deficient).
 * <p>
 * Finally there are methods which bring all these measures together in order
 * to produce a measure of consistency for a list of years or volumes which is
 * the outcome of a particular ordering. These are based on the concepts of
 * (a) how many breaks are in a range and whether they are positive or negative
 * breaks; (b) how much redundancy is in a range; (c) the frequency of coverage
 * gaps produced by an ordering. The definitions of these concepts differ for
 * year and volume, and depending on the ordering context.

   * Two string-based volume identifiers are considered consecutive based on a
   * simple test - if the final numerical token of the second string increments
   * in value while the rest of the string remains the same as in the first,
   * we consider them consecutive. For example, "s1-4" and "s1-5" are
   * considered consecutive (examples taken from Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery).
   * Before comparison, the identifiers are normalised using BibliographicUtil,
   * so that Roman numbers are converted to zero-padded Arabic equivalents.
   * <p>
   * This is a simplistic test but anything more complicated would likely
   * result in false positives. It also is not clever enough to recognise that,
   * for example, "s1-12" and "s2-1" might reasonably be construed as
   * consecutive, especially if they occur in the same or adjacent years.
   * <p>
   * First the strings are compared as numbers; if this doesn't work they
   * are compared alphabetically. If this also fails, the strings are analysed
   * to see if they are equal except for their final numerical tokens, which 
   * should be consecutive. If this yields false, the identifiers are normalised
   * (which converts any Roman numbers to Arabic) and compared again.
   * Finally false is returned if none of these tests yields true.
   * <p>
   * Normalising the identifiers allows us to catch identifier sequences like
   * os-4 and os-V, as seen in OUP.
   * <p>
   * Note that checking haveConsecutiveFinalNumericalTokens on <i>unnormalised 
   * strings</i> is only performed in order to catch identifiers which have an
   * incrementing number somewhere in the middle of a larger string, and which 
   * can also contain tokens that look like Roman numerals. Specifically this 
   * solves an issue with OUP's IEICE Transactions series which contains 
   * consecutive volume identifiers like E89-C and E90-C. 
   * However this is currently the only known case and the test 
   * may add significantly to the processing time.
   * <!--
   * It is also possible to encounter a volume string like "s6-IV". It is
   * harder to establish consecutivity here, as it is necessary to recognise a
   * token that looks like a Roman numeral, and then to see if it parses.
   * To avoid having to do this for every possible token embedded in the string,
   * the definition of "final Roman numeric token" is more restrictive than that
   * for "final digital numerical token", in that it must occur after a non-word
   * character, and be at the end of the string. Given this, we first check if
   * there appears to be a Roman token at the end of the string (which would
   * preclude any numerical tokens following), and if there is none we
   * consider the final numerical token of the string. If the string does end
   * with what appears to be a Roman numeral, but that does not change between
   * the two strings, we fall through to numerical token comparison instead.
   * -->
   * <p>
   * Note that {@link NumberUtil.areConsecutive(String, String)} will accept

   * This method accounts for string-based years, representing either a single

   * more than a year between them.
   * <blockquote>
   * <p>
   * A pair of year ranges are considered to be <i>appropriately consecutive</i>
   * if the second start year is greater than or equal to the first start year
   * while being at most one greater than the first end year (i.e. the start of
   * the second range follows immediately upon or is simultaneous with or is
   * within the first range) or if the first start year is included in the
   * range of the second (i.e. the start of the first range is within the
   * second). That is, it is <i>appropriately sequential</i> and there is no gap
   * between the end of the first range and the start of the second.
   * <br/>
   * <i>Note: perhaps we should also ensure that the first range's end year is
   * less than or equal to the second range's end year.</i>
   * </p>
   * </blockquote>
   * <p>
   * This rather flexible definition accounts for some oddities in the years
   * specified for certain journals - see for example:
   * <ul>
   * <li>Experimental Astronomy vols 3-5</li>
   * <li>Fresenius Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Analytische Chemie vols 275-277</li>

package org.lockss.exporter.biblio;

/**
 * This is the interface for a bibliographic item which is to be used in the
 * <tt>org.lockss.exporter.biblio</tt> package. A bibliographic item represents
 * a volume or range of volumes in a particular title. Clients with proprietary
 * objects representing their bibliographic items can implement this interface
 * either directly or through an adapter class.
 * <p>
 * Implementations may return <tt>null</tt> where values are unavailable.
 * Note that there are accessors for volume, year and issue strings, which may
 * represent ranges, and also for individual start and end values. If the
 * single strings are specified, the start and end accessors should use these
 * strings to provide their data, to maintain consistency. However, the volume,
 * year and issue accessors should return null if no such value is set, rather
 * than attempting to concatenate available start and end values in an arbitrary
 * way. These data are linked and should, as far as possible, not be managed
 * independently. The start and end values should be dependent upon the full
 * values where possible, but this dependency should be unidirectional. It is
 * intended that <code>getStart*</code> and <code>getEnd*</code> methods will be
 * the primary methods used for accessing range data.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface is currently journal-specific, and may need to be
 * expanded into a set of interfaces or a hierarchy, in order to handle books.

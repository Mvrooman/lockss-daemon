 * ordering". KBART does explicitly say (5.3.2.2) to retain leading articles
 * so this is reflected in the default constructor.

 * To allow differing normalisation on different fields, a singleton is 
 * available per field. These are initialised lazily, when needed.
 * In fact it is only necessary to maintain a singleton per normalisation 
 * policy, and provide the appropriate one which matches the field's policy,

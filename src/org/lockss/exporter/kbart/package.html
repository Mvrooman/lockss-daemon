Exporter converting metadata to the KBART format and exporting in CSV or HTML.
Exports can be created for <i>all available titles</i>, <i>configured titles</i>
or <i>preserved titles</i>. The contents of the latter are decided based upon a
value threshold for the <code>org.lockss.daemon.AuHealthMetric</code>.

<p> 
The <a href="http://www.uksg.org/kbart/s1/summary" target="_blank">KBART recommendations</a>
define an ordinal list of fields which must all appear in the output. Given that
our data is incomplete and entire fields can be empty, and the fact in some
applications a pared-down or restructured version of the data is more useful,
certain methods of customising the output have been included.
Though these do not produce a strict KBART output format, the contents of the
fields are KBART compatible.

We have an entry in
<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/kbartregistry/#TOC-LOCKSS" target="_blank">the KBART registry</a>
which should be kept up to date.

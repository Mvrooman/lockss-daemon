 *   <li>Prestarts all threads, for consistent performance including first usage.</li>

 * The thread pool reuses a fixed number of threads operating off a shared
 * unbounded queue. At any point, at most nThreads threads will be active
 * processing tasks. If additional tasks are submitted when all threads are
 * active, they will wait in the queue until a thread is available. If any
 * thread terminates due to a failure during execution prior to shutdown, a
 * new one will take its place if needed to execute subsequent tasks. The
 * threads in the pool will exist until it is explicitly shutdown.

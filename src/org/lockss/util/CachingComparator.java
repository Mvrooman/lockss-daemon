/**
 * Comparator that translates sort keys and caches them, so performance will 
 * be enhanced by reusing the same instance of the comparator.  
 * The {@link getSingleton()} method is provided for that purpose, and can be
 * overridden/redeclared by subclasses wishing to provide their own singleton.
 * For some classes it makes sense to disallow singletons as caching would be 
 * too expensive; in this case they need do nothing as the default behaviour 
 * of getSingleton() is to throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}.  
 * <p>
 * In fact it is only necessary to maintain a single caching singleton per
 * normalisation policy (represented by the boolean {@link NormalisationOption}
 * switches). This is enough to keep the different normalisations in separate 
 * key maps. However these would need to be managed as static instances by 
 * this class and made available to subclasses based on their normalisation 
 * policies. Currently this is not implemented as it may not be appropriate to 
 * keep such instances around if they generate a very large sort key map and 
 * are used infrequently.
 * <p>
 * Singletons should therefore be managed by subclasses according to their 
 * needs.
 * <p>
 * This comparator only compares based on String values, and does not make  
 * use of <code>equals()</code> on non-String objects, meaning it is not 
 * <i>consistent with equals()</i>. This means that the comparator is 
 * unsuitable for providing the ordering in a SortedSet or SortedMap.
 * <p>
 * This class can be extended, specifying a type for the 
 * parameter T, and that type will be compared based on its string value. 
 * If a different string should be used in comparison, this can be specified
 * by overriding the <code>getComparisonString()</code> method.
 * <p>
 * There are options available to perform case-sensitive alphabetic comparison, 
 * to translate accented characters to their unaccented counterparts before 
 * comparison, and to remove initial determiners from the comparison string. 
 * By default the maximum amount of normalisation is performed, though 
 * subclasses may wish to override this.
 * An alternative constructor is provided to allow the construction of an
 * instance with full default normalisation plus a specific approach to 
 * case.
 * <p>
 * Note that setting different normalisation policies, and operating on 
 * different comparison strings, implies different behaviour in the comparator,
 * and therefore a keyMap with different values cached per key. With mixed 
 * normalisation policies in the same comparator, the key map would get 
 * polluted with conflicting normalisations. For this reason it is not 
 * possible to override the comparison options after construction.
 * 
 * @param <T> the type being compared

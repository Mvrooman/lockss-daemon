# This is the Default resource bundle properties file for i18n.
# 
# It is here in order to provide a fallback default for the gettext-commons 
# library which is used to internationalize strings. 
# 
# Without it a MissingResourceException will be thrown when we try to get an 
# I18n instance from the I18nFactory. With it, if gettext is not available on
# the machine doing the build, this bundle will be used to source translations,
# resulting in the untranslated message keys themselves being used as the text.

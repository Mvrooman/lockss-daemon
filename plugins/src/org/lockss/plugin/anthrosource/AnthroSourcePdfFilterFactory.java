 * A new-style PDF filter factory for the American Anthropological
 * Association's former AnthroSource platform (hosted by Atypon
 * Systems).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Originally, this transform normalized the page token streams and
 * the document trailer as part of a simple PDF-to-PDF filter. But the
 * actual diversity of this content (now offline) was greater than the
 * original sample suggested and makes a scraping filter more likely
 * to achieve good results in the field.

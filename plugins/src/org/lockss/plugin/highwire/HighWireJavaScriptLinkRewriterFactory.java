/**
 * Rewrites links in HighWire javascript code.  Handles specific cases as
 * the come up:
 * 
 * 1.PDF articles is displayed in a frameset. A document of the form: 
 * <i>http://jid.sagepub.com/cgi/framedreprint/13/1/55</i> or 
 * <i>http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprintframed/3/9/747</i> have a 
 * window.onload handler that sets a timer, which sets window.location to a 
 * relative URL of the form: </i>/cgi/reprint/13/1/55.pdf</i>. This transform 
 * rewrites the relative URL to a ServeContent relative URL of the form 
 * <i>/ServeContent?url=http://jid.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/13/1/55.pdf</i>.
 * 
 * 2. For any other document, this transform simply removes the window.onload
 * handler of the form: <i>window.onload = handleOnLoad;</i>.
 * 
 * Note that this really should be generalized, using watch handlers on
 * window.location.href and window.open(). This is a standard method on
 * Object since javascript 1.2. Unfortunately, some modern browsers,
 * including Safari 5.1.2 (JS 1.6) and IE 9 don't support it.  
 * 
 * There are several JS shims available (e.g. https://gist.github.com/384583) 
 * that provide the functionality for many browsers, but still not IE 9. This
 * will require further investigation before using any of them.

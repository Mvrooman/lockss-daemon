This is the source tree for the LOCKSS-Jena CMU extended daemon.
See http://www.lockss.org/ for information about the project.

Obtaining Source
----------------

The latest version of this code can be obtained via GIT with

git clone https://github.com/Mvrooman/lockss-daemon

Prerequisites
-------------

Installed Packages:

- Sun JDK 1.6 or greater.

- Ant 1.7.1 or greater.  (http://ant.apache.org/)

- Python 2.5 or greater (but not 3.x) is required in order to build and run
  unit tests, to run the testing frameworks, and to generate plugin jars
  and plugin signing keys.

(On Debian or Ubuntu,
  apt-get install python sun-java6-jdk ant ant-optional
)

- MongoDB 2.2.4 or greater ( Preferably latest MongoDB for performance)
	www.mongodb.org

- Apache Jena 2.10 or greater
	www.apache.org/dist/jena


Other Prerequisites:

- Junit is included in the LOCKSS source distribution, but the Ant targets
  that invoke JUnit (test-xxx) require the JUnit jar to be on Ant's
  classpath.  The easiest way to do that is to copy lib/junit.jar into
  Ant's lib directory (<ant-install-dir>/ant/lib).

- For some of the tools the JAVA_HOME env var must be set to the directory
  in which the JDK is installed.
  

To Build
--------

ant test-all		Builds the system and runs all unit tests
ant test-one -Dclass=org.lockss.foo.TestBar
			Builds the system and runs the tests for one class
ant -projecthelp	Lists other build options
